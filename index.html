        <h2>Career Snapshot</h2>
        <p>
          My working career has been defined by my willingness to take the leap
          into new challenges, constantly leaving my comfort zone to expand my
          knowledge and learn new skillsets. This is where I find joy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have gained experience across various industries in the last decade,
          developing a wide array of technical skills across multiple fields. In
          this process I have developed strong interpersonal skills, enjoying
          working both independantly on projects like my events business, and
          also as a team, being part of many workplaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach has been multi-disciplinary by design, and I am happy to
          be where I am today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of paid work, I have volunteered for charity as part of a team
          to build houses in Cambodia in 2017 & 2018, as well as volunteered on
          five occasions to build stages across two music festivals in NSW
          (Secret Garden & Subsonic) & twice at a festival in the USA (Burning
          Man).
        </p>
        <p>
          My wide skill set has been developed through my various career paths &
          extra-curricular interests, leading me to where I am today and I am
          keenly looking for the right path to pursue as I take the next steps
          in my career.
